# Advent-of-Code-2021
Advent of Code December 2021!  

I will try my best to do the advent of code every day this month. I have come up with all the solutions myself, although there are only so many ways to solve particular problems. If you want to try the challenge yourself, I suggest having a crack at it before looking at my code. Cheating will guarantee yourself a spot on the naughty list. Happy Coding!
